# Discord-Bot

## About Bot
The internet is full of discord bots. Ready or documentation to do them. But I decided to create a repository containing a fully developed bot with many additional features.

## Installation

First you should install **Node.js** via this link below
	https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.1/node-v12.18.1-x64.msi

Create a folder where your bot code will be located. "My Bot" - For example.
	
 Next install **Discord.js** using PowerShell

If you dont know how to do that, follow instructions bellow.
1) Go to your folder where the bot will be located.
2) Shift + Right Mouse Button and select "Open PowerShell window here".
3) Write in PowerShell window `npm install discord.js`.

For the convenience of testing the bot, I recommend installing Nodemon.
Write `npm install -g nodemon` in your PowerShell window.

## Start

If you want to launch your bot, be sure to enter your bot token in `Config-Bot.json`.
Create .bat file in which you will enter the `nodemon Index.js` .

## Clone
Clone this repo to your local machine using `$ git clone https://github.com/Malvare17/Discord-Bot.git`.

Remember that you run the script at your own risk. Also remember that the program was created for educational purposes and the author is not obliged to do anything.
